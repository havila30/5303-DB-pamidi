How long to fly all routes, appended end to end. This will require the routes table. 
So determine the total length of time it would require to travel all routes (assume 500 mph travel speed).

SELECT SUM(ST_Distance_Sphere(b.Location,b1.Location))/500 as Totaldistance FROM A06_routes a,A06_airports b,A06_airports b1
WHERE b.IATA=a.Sourceairport and b1.IATA = a.Destinationairport

Output : 237800905.06680
